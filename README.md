## N736 Homework 01 Files

* This repository contains the files to help you get started on Homework 01 which is due Sept 6, 2017.

* `Homework01.pdf` and `Homework01.Rmd` and `Homework01.html` all are varying formats of the Homework 01 assignment.

* The dataset is available in `*.CSV` and `*.XLX` and `*.XLSX` formats.

* I also uploaded a version with the q2 data shifted up by 1 row - see `Dataset_02_fixq2.xlsx` - feel free to use this file as well. Just remember to note in your analysis report that the q2 shift up 1 row correction was performed on the original datafile.

* Also take a look at the screenshot of the whiteboard [`screenshot_20170830_150136.jpg`] where we noted the various issues we identified in the dataset. _[Many thank you's to Udia for her shared photo!!]_ Use this screenshot and your notes from class to help you get your analysis report together.

* Also take a look at `Dataset_02_Codebook.docx` or `Dataset_02_Codebook.pdf` - this file contains the details on the various "codes" used for this dataset (e.g. you can use these details with `PROC FORMAT` in SAS or `factor()` function in R to label the numeric codes for the categorical and ordinal variables). These is NOT required to complete Homework 01, but it is always useful to make sure your data is labeled appropriately for graphing, tables summaries, etc. That said, there are notes in this "CODEBOOK" that will give you insight into the data - such as Weights should be in pounds; Heights are in decimal feet; and values of 9 and 99 are code indicators for missing.
